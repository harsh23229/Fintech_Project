# Robo-Advisory Firms in India: Industry Review & Strategic Roadmap (2025)

## 📄 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive industry analysis and strategic roadmap for the Indian Robo-Advisory sector as of **November 2025**.

The project was developed as a group assignment to analyze the shift from traditional distribution models to automated "Bionic" advisory services. It covers the impact of the **June 2025 SEBI Master Circular**, the rise of "White Box" algorithms, and a comparative study between the Indian and US wealth-tech markets.

## 🚀 Key Insights & Analysis
The report provides deep-dive analysis into the following areas:

* **Market Intelligence:** Analysis of the **$345 Million** Indian robo-advisory market (growing at 33% CAGR) and the surge in passive funds (Zerodha Fund House, etc.).
* **Regulatory Landscape (2025):** Detailed breakdown of **SEBI's "White Box" vs. "Black Box"** algorithm classification, requiring "Black Box" models to register as Research Analysts.
* **Strategic Roadmap:** A 36-month growth strategy for a hypothetical CEO, proposing a **"Bionic Advisory"** model that combines algorithmic efficiency with human expertise for HNI (High Net-Worth Individual) acquisition.
* **Tech & Governance:** Evaluation of risk profiling using behavioral ML models ("Model Drift" analysis) and compliance dashboards for transparent dispute resolution.
* **Case Studies:** Strategic review of major market moves, such as **Groww’s acquisition of Fisdom** to enter the wealth management space.
